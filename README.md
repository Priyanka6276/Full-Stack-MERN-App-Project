# Productivity App Tailored To Foreign Language Learning

This is a productivity app with the ability to take notes and store vocabulary words for language learners. It was created using the MERN Stack. Data concerning pages, users, and vocabulary words are sent to MONGOdb. 

## Vocabulary List
The vocabulary list features allows the user to input their word in their target language with the defintion. The user can also categorize the word which will be displayed in list form. While at the list, the user can search terms by the word, defintion, or category.

## Notebook
The Notebook was created similarly to the vocabulary list. The user can write down notes about grammar or create journal entries with the notebook. Each page has the date it was created as well as the category, title, and entry itself. On the main notebook page, the user can search terms to find the right page they are looking for.

## User Authorization
Each user must create an account to use the website. The user must input their name, email, and password, which is encrypted to proceed. The name of the user will be displayed when the user logs in. 

## Issues That Still Need To Be Fixed
### Tags
At the beginning the notebook part of the website was to feature tags, where the user can input multiple tags to categorize a page. When the notebook was first created, the tag feature was working. However, at some point during development the server was not recognizing the tags and instead inputting commas. 

## Translator
The app was to feature a translation feature. However, problems were being run into with the api, so this feature must be looked into again. 

## Future Development
Apart from the issues that need to be fixed, I hope to include a flashcard feature to the app so that the user can test their vocabulary knowledge.
